We do not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to these Third Party Sites without obtaining your consent. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Sites.

		  <li><b>Confidentiality, Security and Retention of Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personally Identifiable Information private and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. Studypedia takes reasonable measures to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from disclosure to or access by third parties.

        <h2><strong>Moderation Terms</strong></h2>
        <p>When content is unmoderated, the quality of material posted is difficult to control. The legal advantage, however, is that it is easier to avoid liability for anything that is defamatory, infringing or otherwise unlawful. The only condition is that the operator provides a process for removing offending content expeditiously upon being made aware of it.
		The process for the removal of content will in most cases involve a clear, easy-to-use facility on the site by which users can report inappropriate content to the operator. The operator must then have a clear internal process for dealing with complaints received.</p>
		<p>We provide a link on each material providing page of the website which clearly directs users to the process for reporting inappropriate content. Phrases such as "Report File", "Suggest Edit" are all commonly used as links. The link should take users to a page where the complaint can be detailed. Some users complain about statements without saying why they are complaining; others fail to specify where the offending content is. As an operator we are allowed to demand clarity in a complaint, which will help you to assess the merits of the complaint, and also reduce the number of spurious complaints.</p>
		<p>The complaints about file will be responded back to user and we operators begin addressing such complaints within 24 hours and must report to the complainant the steps it has taken to address the complaint within 72 hours. </p>

        <h2><strong>Plagiarism Checking Terms</strong></h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is defined as the unacknowledged use of the words, ideas or creations of another.  The principal categories of unacknowledged use are unacknowledged quotation, which is failure to credit quotations of another person’s spoken or written words; and unattributed borrowing, which is failure to credit another person’s ideas, opinions, theories, graphs or diagrams.</p>
		<p>It is now a requirement for all users to pass their uploaded materials, be it coursework, thesis, research papers, project reports through plagiarism detection software.  In the case of thesis, research papers and project reports, moderators are required to run the thesis, research paper or project report through plagiarism checking software in order to provide guidance on any revisions that may be required as a result of this process. </p>
		<p><b>What percentages are safe?</b><br/> 
		According to the Turnitin article on Interpreting Turnitin Originality Reports “There are no clear cut rules for this as all work will probably contain some words from other sources. As a guide a returned percentage of below 15% would probably indicate that plagiarism has not occurred. However, if the matching text is one continuous block this could still be considered plagiarism. A high percentage would probably be anything over 25% (Yellow, orange or red). Again this will depend on the students work and the requirements of the report or essay”.  </p>
