# Studypedia LMS

Developed a working Learning Management System website with PHP, MVC, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap CSS. The project is somewhat related to learning management system 
where class notes prepared by each college faculties can be available to students in every college and everywhere, and the moderation was already taken care by itself 
because it's the faculty who're making these notes. However, if students are also making there own class notes then those can be available to everyone but, 
they will get moderated by the faculties who're the member of this website, and before uploading, the notes get checked for plagiarism for any content copyright issue.
